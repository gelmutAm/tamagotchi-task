# How to play

To create a pet press "create" button then choose a character.

To feed a pet press "feed" button and food will appear on a gamefield. To eat food and increase pet's indicators level use "up",
"down", "left" and "right" buttons to move character and get the food.

Every hour pet's happiness and fullness values decrease, if pet doesnt't get food. If fullness value equals zero, pet dies.

Pet grows from teen to elderly. That means, even if pet's indicators level is positive, it dies of old age after some time.

If player wants to create a new pet after death, player have to stay in game and wait for 30 seconds, until gravestone disappears.

The game saves everything player do and keep working even if player close it, so player should monitor the status of their pet all the time.
