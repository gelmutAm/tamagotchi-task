# How to play

To create a pet press "create" button then choose a character.

To feed a pet press "feed" button and food will appear on a gamefield. To eat food and increase pet's indicators level use "up",
"down", "left" and "right" buttons to move character and get the food.

Every hour pet's happiness and fullness values decrease if pet doesnt't get food. If fullness value equals zero, pet dies. 
After pet's death, player can't create a pet for 30 seconds.

Pet grows. That means, if it reaches elderly age, it will die of old age after some time. 

The game saves everything player do and keep working even if player close it, so player should monitor the status of their pet all the time.
